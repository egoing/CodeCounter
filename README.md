# CodeCounter

CodeCounter is an extension feature for Visual Studio Code that calculates cumulative time each time you modify code and starts counting down when you save. This enables effective measurement and management of study time.

## Features

- Each code modification accumulates a certain amount of time (default value is 0.5 seconds).
- When you save the code, a countdown starts according to the accumulated time.

## How to use

1. Open Visual Studio Code and check the wristwatch icon located in the lower left corner. This icon displays the remaining time.

2. When you click the wristwatch icon, you'll see an interface where you can set the amount of time to be added. Set your desired time.

## Purpose

- Instructor: You can quantitatively measure and adjust how much practice time to give to students.
- Student: You can easily check how much practice time is left.

Use CodeCounter to manage your coding class time more effectively.
